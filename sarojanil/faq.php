					I am totally new to this "website thing". How does the whole process work?
				</h4>
				<p>
					Never fear, that's why we are here. You can learn about our time proven process in ourprocess section.

					Why should I hire a professional web design company to design my website?
				</h4>
				<p>
					Website a new sales channel to your business which works 24 hours a day 7 days week irrespective of whether you are on vacation or busy with something. When you open an office or showroom, did you do all of the interior decoration by yourself or some one with no-brand? I am sure you spend lot of resources and got it done in the right way by highly qualified professionals. You did that because, that office/ showroom is the one that gets customers or sends them away. No matter how great products or services that you have, that office or showroom is very important. Isn't it?
				</p>
				<p>
					Note that, you have some people working in that office or showroom to interact with customers where as on the website, it has to do on its own without a live person in the website, since it is virtual showroom or sales office. Just imagine how many efforts your sales person puts to convince the customer about your products and services, which the website has to do by itself without any human presence which indicates how much responsibility a website has and how important it is for your business.
				</p>
				<p>
					Do you really want such a highly important task for your business, which is the heart of your complete internet sales channel for the whole world which should work 24 hours a day 365 days a year, get it done by a fresh college graduate or freelancer? Even though I am highly a qualified professional with noted experience in these services, I did not do dotWeavers.com myself, rather our office did it by taking it as if it is a customer project and by going through all the international standards and our company strict quality control process, because it is important to our business.
				</p>
				<p>
					Website is the image you present to the Internet world. Either it brings more customers or even turns them away forever based on what and how you present it to the customer. If you think you have a great brand offline and can afford to have any kind of website, you are wrong. Having a great brand offline and lousy website will turn away the smart customers who use latest technology. They not only skip buying via your website since they know that you are not competitive in using latest technology effectively, they may also turn away from buying offline thinking you are still using ages old technology in all aspects of your company operations or they think you are technophobia.
				</p>
				<p>
					When you hire dotWeavers.com, you can peacefully focus on your core business while leaving your online business strategy to the experts.

				<h4 class="title-anchor-f">
					How long does it take to design a website for my business?
				</h4>
				<p>
					It varies from website to website based on the requirement. In the initial consultation, we will provide you the timeline estimates for your project.
				</p>
				<p>
					If you have the content for your site written before the design process begins, it will help in completing the project quickly. Content should be in electronic format. Not having your copy completed before the design process can significantly delay the completion of your website.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h4 class="title-anchor-f">
					How much does a website cost?
				</h4>
				<p>
					The cost of a website can vary depending on various factors, just like the cost of a house may vary. Though our website projects generally start in the $5,000 range for basic business sites and range upward depending on your unique needs.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h4 class="title-anchor-f">
					How does the payment process work?
				</h4>
				<p>
					The project starts with a 50% deposit. After design sign off and before we move into programming, we collect 25%. Once we have completed and fulfilled our scope, the final 25% is collected and your website is then scheduled for launch.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h4 class="title-anchor-f">
					Can you help me write content for my website?
				</h4>
				<p>
					Yes. We include copy writing and editing in all of our proposals. We also build your sitemap and help structure the foundation of your website in the planning stages.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h4 class="title-anchor-f">
					Can you help me source photos for my website?
				</h4>
				<p>
					Yes. We will help you source stock photos from sites such as www.crestock.com and www.istock.com. We also have photographers and videographers available to produce custom photography and videos for your website.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h4 class="title-anchor-f">
					Can I See My Website While It's In Progress?
				</h4>
				<p>
					Absolutely! In fact, we encourage it. We build your website on our development server, and provide you with a username and password so that you can log in and monitor the progress of your site. During this phase, we encourage your feedback if something isn't quite the way you envisioned it or if you've changed your mind. Once your site is ready and you have provided your approval, we release it live on your server and submit your URL to the major search engines.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h4 class="title-anchor-f">
					What about payment gateway and shipping integration on eCommerce websites?
				</h4>
				<p>
					We can integrate the most common payment gateways (PayPal, Google Checkout) on our eCommerce websites, however you might have a specific request and it might take some time to study that specific case. We are open to discuss with you and help you during the integration process. It may impact the amount of time we initially defined at the start of the project.
				</p>

				<h4 class="title-anchor-f">
					What is the difference between a "static" and "dynamic" website?
				</h4>
				<p>
					A static website is one that is written in HTML only. Each page is a separate document and there is no database that it draws on. What this means functionally is that the only way to edit the site is to go into each page and edit the HTML - so you'd either have to do it yourself using a web page editor or we can edit the site each time you wanted something changed.
				</p>
				<p>
					A dynamic website is written using more complex code and can do a lot more. For instance, we can make an area where you can log in and change various parts of the website, such as adding information or products or changing existing products. eCommerce websites, news websites are some examples of dynamic websites. This is because each page is constructed based on the information in a database, and the information in that database can be changed via another interface.
				</p>
				<p>
					Dynamic websites can reduce ongoing maintenance costs if you don't want to change things yourself with a web page editor or with the HTML. They usually cost more to develop, as they require more complex coding and a content management utility needs to be developed to help you manage your website information.
				</p>
				<p>
					Another benefit of dynamic websites is that they allow you to change only the content of the website and not the design, so you will not be able to accidentally break the visual style of the website. They have other benefits when websites start to get very large, as they make data management much more efficient and your website more expandable.
				</p>
				<p>
					Many clients do a combination, having some dynamic areas such as a product catalogue where they have to change information or pictures regularly, and leave other pages such as contact information as static pages.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h4 class="title-anchor-f">
					I already have a website, but I want a new design. Can you help?
				</h4>
				<p>
					Absolutely! we can study your current website, analyse it, discuss your goals, and redesign your website according to your requests.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h4 class="title-anchor-f">
					Do I have to host with you?
				</h4>
				<p>
					No, it is not required to host with us. Typically we recommend that our clients host with us because we have standardized our servers to handle all of the services that may be needed for the project deployment. Majority of our clients do host with us and very few choose to keep their existing hosting companies. We will work with you on any scenario.
